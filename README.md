# Scratch Nitro browser extension
Marc92020 and JackyBorderCollie have decided to make a browser extension. But not any kind of extension! It's an extension similar to Scratch Addons, but it enables the features that are in Scratch Nitro, so everyone can experience it! Moreover, it would be much easier to make sneak peek videos with it.
## How do we do this?
We are looking for a good coder, that can make browser extensions, like Scratch Addons. We plan on inviting Jeffalo over, because he contributes to Scratch Addons too.
## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- More users can experience Scratch Nitro
- Way easier to make Scratch Nitro sneak peek videos
- It would be easier for users that don't know how to use Inspect Element
- It would also add Scratch Coins (because they are required to buy Scratch Nitro)
### Cons
- A good extension coder is required
- Others that don't have the extension won't see the special features
- It isn't possible to mention the extension on Scratch, or Scratch Forums
- We don't know how can we get it in Chrome extension store
